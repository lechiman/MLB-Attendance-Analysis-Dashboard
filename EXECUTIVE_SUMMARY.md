# MLB Attendance Analysis - Executive Summary

**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Prepared By:** Senior Data Analyst & Data Scientist  
**Analysis Period:** 2000-2025 (26 Seasons, 780 Team-Seasons, 30 Teams)

## 📊 Bottom Line Up Front

**The Situation:** MLB attendance stabilized in 2025 at 71.4M fans (+0.09% vs 2024), marking a potential turning point after years of decline from the 2007 peak. However, efficiency (attendance per payroll dollar) remains 55% below 2000s levels, despite payrolls increasing 180% since 2000.

**The Good News:** 2025 shows attendance stability after full post-pandemic recovery. Successful turnaround stories continue (San Diego +23%, Toronto +21%, Washington +22%), and efficiency leaders prove smart strategy beats big spending (Padres, Brewers, Rockies).

**The Challenge:** While 2025 stabilization is encouraging, MLB remains 10% below its 2007 peak. Continued innovation in fan experience and operational efficiency is essential to restore growth trajectory.

## 🎯 Three Critical Numbers

### 1. **0.54** - Payroll-Attendance Correlation
Spending matters, but only explains 29% of attendance variation. The other 71% comes from fan experience, marketing, market size, and team history.

**What it means:** Simply increasing payroll won't solve attendance problems. A balanced approach is essential.

### 2. **+0.09%** - 2025 Growth Rate
MLB attendance stabilized in 2025 at 71.4M fans, up slightly from 2024's 71.3M, ending years of decline.

**What it means:** Potential turning point. Recent strategies may be working. Monitor 2026 for trend confirmation.

### 3. **55%** - Efficiency Decline (2000s vs 2020s)
Attendance per payroll dollar has dropped from 35,696 (2000s) to 15,724 (2020-2025 average).

**What it means:** Payroll inflation continues to outpace attendance growth. ROI on player spending remains challenged.

## 💡 Key Insights for Decision-Makers

### Championship Impact Insights 🏆

**Winning Matters:** Teams with championships (2000-2025) average **2.58M fans/season** vs. **1.97M for non-champions** - a difference of **+613K fans/season** (+31% attendance premium).

**Championship Bump:** Post-championship attendance increases average **+34%** the following year (Atlanta 2021: +36%, Angels 2002: +33%, Marlins 2003: +32%).

**Dynasty Effect:** Los Angeles Dodgers won 3 championships (2020, 2024, 2025) and achieved 4.01M attendance in 2025 - first 4M+ season league-wide since 2007!

### Financial Insights

**Payroll ROI:** Every $1M in additional payroll generates ~7,200 fans, or $360K in direct ticket revenue (36% ROI at $50/ticket). This is positive but declining—and doesn't account for full revenue streams (concessions, merchandise, sponsorships).

**Efficiency Trend:** The cost of attracting fans has nearly doubled in two decades. Teams must find new ways to drive attendance beyond roster spending.

**Market Concentration:** Top 5 teams capture 22% of all MLB attendance. Market power is highly concentrated.

### Operational Insights

**Most Predictable Teams:** Cardinals, Red Sox, Cubs have lowest attendance variability—easiest for operational planning.

**Most Volatile Teams:** Nationals, Blue Jays, Marlins have highest variability—require flexible operational models.

**Staffing Implications:** Predictable teams can optimize costs; volatile teams need surge capacity.

### Strategic Insights

**What Works:**
- ✅ **Winning championships** (+613K fans/season premium, +34% post-championship bump)
- ✅ Smart spending (Padres, Brewers, Astros lead efficiency)
- ✅ Consistency (Cardinals 84% of years in top quartile, 4 WS appearances, 2 wins)
- ✅ New stadiums (Washington, Philadelphia turnarounds)
- ✅ Aggressive building (Padres, Blue Jays growth)
- ✅ **Dynasty building** (Dodgers 3 championships in 6 years → 4M+ attendance)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Spending alone without winning (Yankees, Red Sox have low efficiency despite 2 championships each)
- ❌ Cost-cutting without strategy (Athletics -58%, 0 championships)
- ❌ Neglecting fan experience (several high-variance teams)

### Crisis Response

**2008 Financial Crisis:** Minimal impact (-1.08% YoY). Baseball is relatively recession-resistant.

**2020 COVID-19:** Complete shutdown followed by rapid recovery (94% by 2022). Demonstrates underlying demand strength.

**Resilience Lesson:** Fans return when given the opportunity—latent demand exists.
